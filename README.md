# The BHive
im going to avoid my usual mistake of writing the documentation before i make the project and then having to rewrite it because i did everything differently than how i planned to :)  
Plans can be found on my channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4nBRwdqYw0


# Roadmap

1. **Project Planning and Initial Setup**
   - Outline Objectives and Requirements
     - Define the main goals of the Beehive project.
     - List hardware and software requirements.
   - Evaluate Current Setup
     - Document current VPS providers and cloud storage solutions.
     - List existing home servers and their configurations.

2. **Current Infrastructure Analysis**
   - Identify current issues with SSH, Docker setup, and system reinstallation.

3. **Design and Architecture**
   - Create a Network Diagram
     - Visualize the desired network setup including home servers, cloud providers, and the conductor node.
   - Security Planning
     - Plan firewall rules and network segmentation.
     - Determine authentication mechanisms (e.g., Aelia, 2FA).

4. **Hardware and Software Acquisition**
   - Collect all necessary hardware (home servers, networking equipment).
   - Ensure all hardware meets project requirements.

5. **Install Base Operating Systems**
   - Install Ubuntu or other preferred OS on all servers.

6. **Unified VPS and Home Server Management**
   - Integrate cloud storage providers using rclone.
   - Set up a centralized management interface for all servers.

7. **Automation Scripts and Configuration**
   - Develop Automation Scripts
     - Write scripts for server setup and configuration.
     - Create Docker-compose files for each service.
   - Orchestrator Node Setup
     - Configure the conductor node with Nginx for load balancing and reverse proxy.
     - Implement secure remote access through SSH for troubleshooting.
     - Implement script to add new servers to the fleet.

8. **Service Deployment**
   - Service Setup
     - Develop and test setup scripts for each service (e.g., Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Calibre-web).
     - Configure services to run in Docker containers.
   - Resource Allocation
     - Set up the orchestrator node to handle resource allocation for new servers and services.

9. **Security Implementation**
   - Configure Firewall Rules
     - Apply strict firewall rules on all servers.
     - Ensure no server can be accessed by its IP directly.
   - Set Up Authentication
     - Implement Aelia for user authentication.
     - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).

10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
    - Set up Grafana for monitoring server health and performance.
    - Implement logging and alerting mechanisms.
    - Regularly update and maintain all scripts and configurations.
    - Implement a backup strategy for configuration files and scripts (e.g., GitHub).

11. **Testing and Troubleshooting**
    - Test Server Connectivity
      - Verify SSH connections and remote access to all servers.
      - Test reverse SSH tunnels for reliability.
    - Service Testing
      - Ensure all services are accessible via the orchestrator node.
      - Check the performance and reliability of services.

12. **Documentation and Maintenance**
    - Document Setup Procedures
      - Create detailed documentation for setting up and adding new servers and services.
      - Write guides for common troubleshooting steps.
    - Backup and Failover Planning
      - Implement backup strategies for setup scripts and configurations.
      - Plan for failover mechanisms if required in the future.

13. **Review and Feedback**
    - Gather Feedback
      - Present the initial setup to peers for feedback.
      - Make adjustments based on the feedback received.
    - Continuous Improvement
      - Regularly review the setup for potential improvements.
      - Stay updated with the latest best practices in home lab setups.
