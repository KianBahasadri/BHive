To achieve a seamless and automated deployment of your services across multiple nodes without the headache of manual configuration, you can leverage a combination of tools and concepts designed for container orchestration, service discovery, and dynamic reverse proxying. Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Container Orchestration with Docker Swarm**:
   - **What is it?** Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and scheduling tool. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker engine.
   - **Why use it?** It's simpler than Kubernetes, less resource-intensive, and ideal for smaller setups like yours.
   - **How it helps you:** Docker Swarm allows you to deploy services (Docker containers) across multiple nodes automatically. It handles the scheduling, ensuring containers run on the best-suited nodes based on resource availability.

2. **Dynamic Reverse Proxying with Traefik**:
   - **What is it?** Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that integrates with your existing infrastructure components (Docker, Swarm, etc.) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
   - **Why use it?** Unlike NGINX, Traefik doesn't require manual configuration updates when services change. It listens to events from your orchestrator (like Docker Swarm) and updates its routing accordingly.
   - **How it helps you:** Traefik will automatically discover your Docker containers and route traffic to them based on rules you define using labels in your Docker Compose files. No need to manually edit configuration files.

3. **Configuration Management with SaltStack**:
   - **What is it?** SaltStack is a powerful configuration management and remote execution tool.
   - **Why use it?** You're already using SaltStack, so you can leverage it to automate the setup and configuration of your entire environment.
   - **How it helps you:** SaltStack can automate the provisioning of Docker Swarm on your nodes, deploy Traefik, and manage your Docker services.

4. **Networking with WireGuard**:
   - **What is it?** WireGuard is a simple, fast, and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography.
   - **Why use it?** It ensures secure communication between your nodes and can assign consistent IPs to them.
   - **How it helps you:** WireGuard provides a secure network overlay, allowing your services to communicate securely. Docker Swarm services can be configured to use this network.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Set Up Docker Swarm Cluster**:
   - Initialize Docker Swarm on your hub node.
   - Join your client nodes to the Swarm cluster using the join token.

   ```bash
   # On hub node
   docker swarm init --advertise-addr <hub-node-ip>

   # On client nodes
   docker swarm join --token <join-token> <hub-node-ip>:2377
   ```

2. **Deploy Traefik as a Swarm Service**:
   - Create a Docker Compose file for Traefik.
   - Configure Traefik to use the Docker provider and enable swarm mode.

   ```yaml
   version: '3.7'

   services:
     traefik:
       image: traefik:v2.4
       command:
         - "--providers.docker.swarmMode=true"
         - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
         - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       volumes:
         - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
       deploy:
         placement:
           constraints:
             - node.role == manager
   ```

   - Deploy Traefik:

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c traefik-compose.yml traefik
   ```

3. **Define and Deploy Your Services with Docker Compose**:
   - Create Docker Compose files for your services.
   - Use Docker labels to define how Traefik should route traffic to your services.

   Example service definition:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.7'

   services:
     my-service:
       image: your-docker-image
       deploy:
         labels:
           - "traefik.enable=true"
           - "traefik.http.routers.my-service.rule=Host(`my-service.example.com`)"
           - "traefik.http.services.my-service.loadbalancer.server.port=80"
   ```

   - Deploy your services:

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c my-service-compose.yml myservice
   ```

4. **Automate with SaltStack**:
   - Use SaltStack to automate the deployment process.
   - Write Salt states to:
     - Install Docker and initialize Swarm on nodes.
     - Deploy Traefik and your services.
     - Manage updates and scaling.

5. **Configure WireGuard Networking**:
   - Set up WireGuard on all nodes to ensure secure and consistent networking.
   - Configure Docker Swarm to use the WireGuard network for service communication.

**Benefits of This Approach**:

- **Automation**: Once set up, adding a new service is as simple as writing a Docker Compose file with the appropriate labels and deploying it.
- **No Manual Configuration**: Traefik automatically updates its routing configuration when services are added or removed.
- **Scalability**: Docker Swarm can scale services up or down across your nodes based on resource availability.
- **Simplicity**: This setup avoids the complexity of Kubernetes while providing robust orchestration features.

**Alternative Options**:

- **Using NGINX with Dynamic Configuration**:
  - You can use tools like [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for service discovery and [consul-template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) to dynamically generate NGINX configurations.
  - **Downside**: This adds complexity and may require more maintenance compared to Traefik.

- **Ansible for Configuration Management**:
  - If you're more comfortable with Ansible, it can replace SaltStack.
  - **Downside**: Since you're already using SaltStack, switching might not be beneficial.

- **Kubernetes**:
  - Provides advanced orchestration features.
  - **Downside**: Overkill for your needs and introduces significant complexity.

**Summary**:

- **Tools to Use**:
  - **Docker Swarm**: For container orchestration and automatic scheduling.
  - **Traefik**: For dynamic reverse proxying without manual configuration.
  - **SaltStack**: For automating the provisioning and deployment of your infrastructure.
  - **WireGuard**: For secure networking between nodes.

- **What This Approach is Called**:
  - **Container Orchestration**: Managing the lifecycle of containers across multiple hosts.
  - **Service Discovery**: Automatically detecting services in your network.
  - **Dynamic Reverse Proxying**: Automatically routing traffic to services without manual configuration.

- **Your Options**:
  - **Adopt the Docker Swarm and Traefik approach** for simplicity and automation.
  - **Stick with NGINX and use service discovery tools**, but be prepared for added complexity.
  - **Explore other orchestration tools** like Nomad if Docker Swarm doesn't meet your needs.

**Final Thoughts**:

This solution balances automation and simplicity, reducing manual intervention while avoiding the complexity of more heavyweight tools. By leveraging Docker Swarm and Traefik, you can efficiently manage your services and enjoy dynamic routing without the need to manually configure NGINX or manage IP assignments.
